Description

“PrintCade: Invaders” is a physical interface for the classic arcade game, “Space Invaders”. Built with recycled components such as printers, computer fans, joysticks with arcade buttons, and LED light arrays, the installation creates a physical connection between players and the virtual game system by generating analog sounds created by recycled electronic components acting as outputs. Players blast aliens projected on the wall above the piece while simultaneously creating physical feedback through the control interface that mimics the original 1980s arcade aesthetic. The end result is an aesthetically rich journey into the world of analog interfaces and virtual classic game output.
